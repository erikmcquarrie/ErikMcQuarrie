My Name is Erik McQuarre, I am a software engineer with a huge passion for video games. You'll notice that I have both individual projects and shared projects on my github. Just know that I greatly value projects that involve collaboration. I find working with others as a great way to keep my mind fresh and to consistantly learn new ways of doing things.

I take pride in what I do, so please check out some of my projects and let me know what you think.
